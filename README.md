# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
This text-based Java implementation of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock brings an engaging twist to the classic selection game, incorporating the expanded rules: Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes Lizard, Lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates Lizard, Lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and rock crushes scissors. Played as a ”best-of-3” competition, the game pits a human player against a computer opponent, with choices and outcomes driven by object-oriented principles. It features a modular design with an abstract Choice class and specific subclasses for each gesture, leveraging polymorphism to dynamically determine results and provide round explanations like ”Spock vaporizes Rock.” The game includes a leaderboard that tracks and sorts player wins using a bubble sort algorithm and supports searching for specific players.
